The Personal Budgeting Project involves analyzing and optimizing personal financial data through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization. The project is structured into three key components:

Data Cleaning (My Finances(Cleaning))
  This phase includes the preparation of raw financial data for analysis by:
    Creating a backup of the original dataset.
    Removing unnecessary rows, renaming columns for clarity, and handling missing or invalid values.
    Converting data types (e.g., date formatting) and ensuring consistency across entries.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (My Finances(EDA))
  This analysis identifies key insights from the dataset, including:
    Summary of total income, expenses, and average monthly financials.
    Classification of expenses into essential and non-essential categories, with percentage breakdowns.
    Trend analysis to highlight monthly fluctuations in income, spending, and savings.
    Identification of the largest spending categories and areas for potential savings.

Personal Budgeting Dashboard
  A dashboard visualizes key financial indicators and trends, offering actionable insights:
    Display of total income, expenses, savings, and savings rate.
    Month-to-month comparisons of income, spending, and savings.
    Breakdown of essential vs. non-essential spending.
    Identification of high-spending categories and trends for better budgeting decisions.
